# A Formal Framework for Pragmatic Existentialism

A logical formalization of a philosophical system that integrates existentialist agency, pragmatic truth, and ethical cooperation based on shared challenges ("antagonisms").

## üìñ Overview

This repository contains a formal logical framework for a philosophy termed **Pragmatic Existentialism**. The system is built from the ground up using first-order logic to define its core tenets:

*   **Ontology:** Reality is composed of conscious systems and objective "antagonisms" (problems, constraints).
*   **Epistemology:** Truth is pragmatic and defined by a belief's role within a *coherent worldview* that enables a system to overcome the antagonisms relevant to it.
*   **Ethics:** Cooperation emerges naturally from shared vulnerability, and ethical rules are those that reliably lead to mutual flourishing.

The formalism provides a precise, computable-like structure for reasoning about beliefs, truth, cooperation, and ethics.

## üß† Core Ideas

*   **Antagonistic Reality:** Existence is defined by navigating objective problems (`A(a)`).
*   **Relevance:** Problems are scoped to a system's specific context (`Rel(a, s)`).
*   **Worldview Coherence:** Fitness against challenges is an emergent property of a system's entire, consistent belief set (`C(s) ‚Üí F(s, a)`).
*   **Pragmatic Truth:** A belief is "true" if it is part of a coherent and functional worldview for some system.
*   **Antagonistic Cooperation:** Cooperation is a logical response to a shared, relevant problem that neither party can solve alone.
*   **Consequentialist Ethics:** Rules are ethical if they are reliable engines of mutual success.

## üìÅ Repository Contents

*   `FORMALISM.md`: The complete set of primitives, predicates, axioms, and definitions.
*   `README.md`: This file, providing an introduction and overview.

## üöÄ Getting Started

You don't need to install anything to explore the formalism. The best way to engage is:

1.  **Read the Framework:** Start with [`FORMALISM.md`](./FORMALISM.md). It is written to be read sequentially.
2.  **Understand the Primitives:** Pay close attention to the predicates (`S(x)`, `A(a)`, `Rel(a, s)`, `C(s)`) as they are the building blocks.
3.  **Trace the Logic:** Follow the logical flow from the Axiom of Antagonism to the final Imperative.
4.  **Apply the Model:** Think of real-world systems (individuals, companies, nations, AIs) and antagonisms (scarcity, disease, misinformation). How does the model hold up?

## üí° Applications & Future Work

This formal framework is designed to be a foundation for:

*   **Philosophical Analysis:** A precise tool for debating pragmatism, existentialism, and ethics.
*   **AI Safety & Alignment:** Providing a possible mathematical framework for defining values and cooperation mechanisms for artificial agents.
*   **Social & Political Modeling:** Modeling the emergence of cooperation and shared ethics between groups with conflicting worldviews but shared problems (e.g., climate change).
*   **Formal Verification:** The logical structure could, in theory, be used to check the consistency of ethical rules or belief systems within the model.

**Potential Next Steps:**
*   Formalize the model in a proof assistant like Coq or Lean.
*   Develop simple computational simulations based on the axioms.
*   Write papers applying the framework to specific problems in AI ethics or political philosophy.
