**Pragmatic Existentialism: Crafting Meaning Through Coherence and Cooperation**

In a world of complexity—climate crises, societal divisions, and technological upheavals—how do we, as individuals, societies, or even artificial intelligences, find meaning and thrive? Traditional philosophies often point to absolute truths or divine purposes, but these can feel distant in a reality defined by tangible challenges and constant change.

Pragmatic existentialism offers a compelling alternative: meaning, truth, and morality are not discovered but built through the deliberate alignment of our beliefs with the demands of reality. This philosophy asserts that every conscious system—whether a person, a society, or an AI—must cultivate a coherent, practical belief system to navigate life’s challenges, cooperate with others, and achieve flourishing.

## Core Principles

### 🧠 Coherence Over Certainty
Reality presents objective challenges—**antagonisms**—such as scarcity, conflict, or mortality. Every conscious system must confront these using a **coherent belief system**: a worldview that is internally consistent and grounded in real-world outcomes. Contradictory beliefs lead to missteps and vulnerability.

### 🧪 Truth as Practical Utility
A belief is **true** if it contributes to a system’s ability to overcome its challenges. Truth is not an abstract ideal but a **practical tool**. This empowers systems to test beliefs against reality and adapt.

### 🤝 Cooperation as a Necessity
When systems face shared antagonisms—like climate change or pandemics—**cooperation becomes essential**. By working together, systems achieve **mutual flourishing** beyond individual capabilities.

### ⚖️ Ethics from Outcomes
Rules or strategies are **ethical** if they consistently lead to mutual flourishing for all cooperating systems. Ethics emerge from **practical success**, not abstract principles.

## Applications

- **Personal Development**: Building resilient, adaptable worldviews.
- **Societal Challenges**: Addressing polarization and climate action through shared understanding.
- **AI Alignment**: Designing systems that cooperate with humans to solve complex problems.
- **Open Collaboration**: Models like open-source software demonstrate cooperative flourishing.
