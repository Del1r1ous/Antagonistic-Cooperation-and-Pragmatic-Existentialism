# Pragmatic-Stratified Set Theory (PSST)

A formal axiomatic system that partitions all entities into Objective and Abstract sets, modeling the interaction between mind-independent reality and mental constructs.

## Core Definitions

### Primitive Sets
- **Universal Set (U)**: The set of all conceivable entities
- **Objective Set (O ⊂ U)**: Mind-independent entities (physical objects, forces, constraints)
- **Abstract Set (A ⊂ U)**: Mind-dependent constructs (ideas, models, symbols, beliefs)
- **Conscious Systems (S ⊂ O)**: Goal-directed entities capable of holding beliefs

### Axioms
1. **Primordial Partition**: O ∪ A = U and O ∩ A = ∅
2. **Primacy of the Objective**: ∀s ∈ S, ∃o ∈ O such that Rel(o, s)
3. **Coherence Condition**: Defines coherent abstract subset C ⊆ A where ∀c ∈ C, Coherent(c)

## Core Functions

### Modeling Function
`Model: O → P(A)` - Maps objective entities to abstract representations

### Realization Function
`Realize: A → P(O)` - Maps abstract constructs to objective entities they represent

### Fitness Predicate
`Fits: A × O → {True, False}` - Evaluates if abstract construct successfully fits objective entity

## Pragmatic Truth Definition

For a conscious system s ∈ S with coherent belief set (P(s) ⊆ C), an abstract construct a ∈ P(s) is **True** if and only if:

`True(s, a) ↔ ∀o ∈ O ( (Rel(o, s) ∧ o ∈ Realize(a)) → Fits(a, o) )`

## Stratification

The Abstract Set A is partitioned into hierarchical layers {A_i}:
- **A₀**: Base layer (concrete constructs)
- **A_n**: Higher layers (increasingly abstract constructs)

With grounding function: `G: A_n → P(A₀)`

## Theorems

1. **Unattainability of Perfect Truth**: ¬∃a ∈ A such that ∀o ∈ O, Fits(a, o)
2. **Necessity of Hierarchical Refinement**: Models can be iteratively refined to address failures while preserving coherence
