### The Fiduciary Duty of a Coherent Worldview

A coherent worldview functions as our primary risk-detection system—the cognitive immune system that identifies threats before they materialize into harm. Just as a fragmented security camera network creates blind spots for intruders, an incoherent worldview contains fatal gaps where dangers can approach undetected. The individual therefore has a direct fiduciary duty to themselves to maintain worldview coherence, for the most basic form of personal security is predictive accuracy about reality's patterns and dangers.

This duty extends beyond mere self-protection into the social realm through two essential practices: actively inviting criticism and securing trust for cooperation. When we solicit challenges to our beliefs, we perform crucial stress-testing on our cognitive frameworks. The critic serves as a red team for our worldview, exposing vulnerabilities we cannot see ourselves—whether faulty assumptions, missing information, or logical inconsistencies that create real-world blind spots. This voluntary vulnerability paradoxically becomes our greatest strength in risk assessment.

Trust-based cooperation represents the ultimate pragmatic test of worldview coherence. Others instinctively gauge the reliability of our mental models through consistency between our predictions and outcomes. A coherent worldview demonstrates its worth not through rhetorical victory but through repeated accurate forecasting and successful navigation of complex situations. This proven reliability becomes the foundation for the deep trust required for meaningful cooperation—whether in business partnerships, personal relationships, or community organizing.

The individual who neglects this duty to coherence ultimately violates their fiduciary responsibility to both themselves and potential allies. They become walking liabilities—unable to accurately assess threats themselves and unreliable as cooperative partners. Their poor risk detection endangers not only themselves but those who depend on them. Thus, the maintenance of a coherent, criticism-tested worldview transforms from philosophical preference to essential personal and social responsibility—the bedrock upon which safety and successful cooperation are built.
